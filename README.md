# Advent Of Code 2022

My effort of the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com) contest

### Thursday, December 1, 2022

I woke up at 7:19 (CET) and stayed in bed for a long time, thinking about
how I am going to approach Adcent of Code this year. I thought about a
more mathematical approach. Descriping the puzzles in terms of mathematics
and design a language and interpreter that can solve those mathematical
expressions.

I got up and at 8:56 I opened my laptop, created this repository and
started writing this. I think, I will try a [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
style with fragments of code that are extended in steps as described in
[Literate programming with Markdown](https://www.iwriteiam.nl/D2101.html#13)
using [MarkDownC](https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse/blob/master/README.md#markdownc).

At 9:13, I got some warnings, when I compiled `MarkDownC`. Let see if I can
fix those first. Fixed with [a9ff4bb9](https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse/commit/a9ff4bb98d9c900878fb026d0f7290c168a57cf0) commit.

See further [Day 1](Day01.md).

In the evening, I started working on [a language](Language.md).

### Friday, December 2, 2022

I read the puzzle before I went to work and thought about it during the
day. See further [Day 2](Day02.md).

### Saturday, December 3, 2022

I solved the puzzles during the day, taking a break to do some duties.
See further [Day 3](Day03.md).

Later, I expanded [the language](Language.md) such that it can calculate
the second answer for the first puzzle.

### Sunday, December 4, 2022

I started around 11 and found the answers in about three quarters of
an hour (also consuming some food as brunch).
See further [Day 4](Day04.md).

Later, I spend some time expanded [the language](Language.md) such that
it can calculate the answer for todays puzzle.

### Monday, December 5, 2022

I read the puzzle in the morning before went to my work. During the day,
I did think a little about it.

See further [Day 5](Day05.md).

### Tuesday, December 6, 2022

I started just after 8 in the morning.
See further [Day 6](Day06.md).

### Wednesday, December 7, 2022

I did a speed-run to finish the first puzzle before I went to work.
In the evening, I spend some time solving the second puzzle.
See further [Day 7](Day07.md).

### Thursday, December 8, 2022

I started around 18:23 (CET) and finished the parts at 18:52:01 (CET)
and 19:03:47 (CET). See further [Day 8](Day08.md).

### Friday, December 9, 2022

A finished the first part in the morning. The second part in the evening.
See further [Day 9](Day09.md).

### Saturday, December 10, 2022

I did the first part in the morning and decide to leave the second part
for later. In only finished is around nine in the evening. 
See further [Day 10](Day10.md).

### Sunday, December 11, 2022

Around a quarter pas 10 in the morning, I started working on
the first part. It took me about two hours to finished. The
second part is a bit harder. After having gone for a walk,
I finished the second part as well.
See further [Day 11](Day11.md).

In the evenig, I spend some time working on [the language](Language.md).
Although, I got it working for some puzzles, I think, I will stop
developing. I noticed that [Brian Chen](https://github.com/betaveros) is using
[noulith](https://github.com/betaveros/noulith/), a language he developed
himself, for in his [Advent of Code 2022](https://github.com/betaveros/advent-of-code-2022#readme).

### Monday, December 12, 2022

I started around 7:40 (CET). Still took me about 1 hour 20 minutes
to find the solutions to both puzzles. I think, I should spend some
more time reading the text of the puzzle.
See further [Day 12](Day12.md).

### Tuesday, December 13, 2022

I spend some time in the morning, from 9:17 till 10:38 working,
but did not get far enough to solve the first puzzle.
The rest of the day, I was busy with work and I only continued
working in the evening.
See further [Day 13](Day13.md).

### Wednesday, December 14, 2022

I started at 7:28 in the morning and was able to finish both
puzzles at 9:05.
See further [Day 14](Day14.md).

### Thursday, December 15, 2022

I spend almost two hours to solve the first part of the puzzle
in the moring and about 15 minutes in the evening to finish the
second part.
See further [Day 15](Day15.md).

### Friday, December 16, 2022

I started in the morning, but was not able to finish even the
first puzzle. When I continued in the evening, I soon found
the first answer, but I spend many hours for the seconds answer.
See further [Day 16](Day16.md).

### Saturday, December 17, 2022

I read the puzzle description in the moring, I worked about
two hours in the afternoon to find the first answer, and
some hours in the evening, to find the second answer.
See further [Day 17](Day17.md).

### Sunday, December 18, 2022

I started just befor 9 and finished just before 10. This was
a relatively simple puzzle, one that I would expect as an
exercise in a first programming course.
See further [Day 18](Day18.md).

Afterwards, I made some small changes to MarkDownC such any
syntax error is displayed by the C compiler (gcc or clang)
as an unterminated string. I also started using the `&&` in
the command line, such that the program is not executed when
there was a compile error.

### Monday, December 19, 2022

I spend two hours in the morning and most of the evening.
I did look up some hints. Without using those hints, only
to get the confirmation about the fact that only one robot
per minute can be build, I succeeded to find the first answer.
With the help of the hints, I was able to find an answer
for the second part. I did not verify it, because I do not
want to earn a star now, because I feel that I did not solve
the puzzle by myself. I also did not record all the steps I
made on the [Day 1](Day19.md) page.

I read [No aggregating inputs](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/)
and decided to remove the input files that I had included in
this repository simply by pushing a commit without them
using `git push --force`.

### Tuesday, December 20, 2022

I spend some hours in the morning and some hours in the
evening to solve the puzzle.
See further [Day 20](Day20.md).

I also spend some time on the puzzle of yesterday and
succeeded in finding the answer for the second puzzle,
without using the hints. The program needed a bit more than
half an hour to finish.

### Wednesday, December 21, 2022

I read the puzzle description in the morning. I thought about it
during the day. It was at 18:40 (CET) that I started working
on writing code to find the answers. I found this relatively
easy and it also went quite smooth with no nasty bugs.
See further [Day 21](Day21.md).

### Thursday, December 22, 2022

I was busy during the day and only started working on the
puzzle in the evening. The second part was a little more
work.
See further [Day 22](Day22.md).

### Friday, December 23, 2022

I took my notebook to the office and started during the break.
In the evening, it took me some time to finish the puzzle.
See further [Day 23](Day23.md).

### Saturday, December 24, 2022

The first part of the puzzle looked rather easy and I was
afraid that the second part was going to be a lot harder,
but it was not. Although it still took me an hour to get
some details straight.
See further [Day 24](Day24.md).

### Sunday, December 25, 2022

I woke up early and around 6:04 (CET) went downstairs to
get my laptop. After having read the puzzle text, I began
to write the code. I only made two small mistakes in the
print function and did not bother to test with the example
input. 
See further [Day 25](Day25.md).
